		<h2><b>Fund Wrap-Up</b></h2>
		<p class="smalltext">All of the funds except precious metals turned in
 solid gains last year. Here's a fund-by-fund rundown on 1997 and brief 
predictions for 1998.</p>

							What a year! Aggressive growth turned in a gain of 26.4%, led by 
high-tech and small over-the-counter stocks. About next year, fund 
manager Jim Charney says,"<i>We're still optimistic about a bull market</i>, but it'll be hard to top 1996-97."

					Things were a bit volatile on the international front this past 
year, but overall we turned in a 16% gain, led by European stocks. Fund 
manager Jill Jones, however, is optimistic about the future. "<i>We're expecting the Japanese stocks to rally this year,</i>" says Jill.

				<p class="smalltext">
					Not a great year for the metals, but we held our own and 
experienced small gains in gold and platinum. But that small gain paled 
in comparison to the security that precious metals gave our clients, 
especially in this volatile market. Metals continue to be an extremely 
safe hedge against all the other markets.

					The end of the year rally pushed the bond fund up, resulting in a 
9.3% return for the year. The outlook for next year? "It all depends on 
the Fed," says fund manager Patty Weigel. "<i>We don't anticipate much interest rate cutting, so that should be good news for our clients.</i>"
